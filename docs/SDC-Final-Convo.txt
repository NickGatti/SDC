I was responsible for building and scaling a service in 3 weeks.

The major problems I faced were finding and uncapping bottlenecks

Postgres turned out to be the first major one, at 100 requests per second.

Postgres has some tuning that can make it work faster, so I tweaked it which resulted
in a minor improvement. About 15 requests per second better.

Postgres was still the problem.

Scaling postgres didnt seem as fruitful as using a caching system like redis.

So instead of scaling Postgres, I decided to cache all the data on
Redis shards which are much faster. Which resulted in a major improvement in
the load capacity. It went from about 115 rps to around 250.

The next big bottleneck were the node services.

I decided to use ngingx to load balance multiple node services which resulted in a huge
improvement, going from 250 rps to over 1400.

Scaling beyond that required more money so I stopped there.
