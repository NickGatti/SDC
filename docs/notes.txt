================================

We chose postgreSQL for our SQL database because it has the best performance under high loads.

We chose CouchDB for our NoSQL database because of its ease use and the protocol is http based.
It is document based and has good performance.

================================

Export postgreSQL pg_dump -U username dbname -N topology -T spatial_ref_sys > dbexport.pgsql
Import postgreSQL psql -U username dbname < dbexport.pgsql

Import couchDB cat myFile.json | lwp-request -m POST -sS "http://localhost/dbname/_bulk_docs" -c "application/json"
or cat myFile.json | POST -sS "http://myDB.couchone.com/testDB" -c "application/json"
