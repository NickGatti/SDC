my family had a lot of computer type people in it, and i was very interested in how
they worked, espeically programming, i grew up around it.

good with overcoming awkward boundaries because i dont care how 
i look as much as most other people, very gung ho about things
i did acting as a child and putting myself out there been with me
early and never left me, this skill is useful pretty much anywhere
everywhere, i dont get down over being critized or being put down.

good with communication and being able to understand without having to say anything
its something i was really bad at as a kid and wanted to be able to do
got really good at it as an adult

good with learning from people, ive always been better at learning from a person
and being hands on with the things i learn. this is because i like to explore all
possiblities, usually the wrong things first so i know right away what doesnt work.
and just trying things instead of sitting around and thinking about something too long.
